Kill some people.\n                     \n                     Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.\n                     \n                     Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location.

This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\n                     \n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die, you can approach it a completely different way.\n                     \n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\n                     \n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\n                     \n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\n                     \n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, I heartily recommend buying it.\n                     \n                     One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter.

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', ""Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites.

Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."", ""The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",1.1K,235,1.7K,1.9K

135,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Jun 23, 1991","['Sonic Team', 'Sega']",3.1,1.1K,1.1K,['Platform'],"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers, it seriously is a classic."", 'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']",8.5K,135,1.9K,1.2K

Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls, because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks, so just stick to the A-game.

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","['É o meu game de plantaforma preferido, ja zerei diversas vezes, e nunca deixa de ser divertido.

The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.","['Ace Attorney at its best.

Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the ""Sanctuary"" theme song instead of ""Passion"". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.","['Best game in the series drive forms were fun summons were fun, good story and the combat/movement was so smooth especially when you start unlocking drive form abilities as base sora.', 'peak fiction at its finest', ""To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series, and to be fair there's a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, it's going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable."", ""In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought I'd say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space."", 'This game is extremely nostalgic for me, I can still see myself turning on the ps2 and playing the og game.

You wake up in an unfamiliar environment, only to realize that you're stuck in a dream - a dream where perception is reality. Welcome to Superliminal.
             

              Superliminal is a first-person puzzle game inspired perspective and optical illusions. Players tackle impossible puzzles by thinking outside the box and learning to expect the unexpected.

I\'m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\'t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\'t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game ""the next portal"" like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. All in all, it didn\'t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!', 'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\'m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one ""thing"" like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\'s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away.

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills.

Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms.

Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\'ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design.

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante, que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original, e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época, apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem, o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.', 'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais, que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.', ""As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day, I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall, a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well, especially the parkour.

The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']",8.5K,135,1.9K,1.2K

Meanwhile, horror games operate on the concept of player\n                     \n                      disempowerment\n                     \n                     , giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere, so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. Resident Evil games are famous for trying to do so, but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half, without a true blending of the concepts. The Evil Within meanwhile actually managed it, but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. Firstly, the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first, leaving players unable to find their footing, confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. Then, the mechanical restrictions feel like they’re equally arbitrary: Sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets, and not even a full healthbar’s worth of recovery. He can barely run at all, and in order to alleviate any of this, you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. It can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths, but once you commit to learning the game, a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. While the story\n                     \n                      is\n                     \n                     mostly nonsense, the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. With new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace, players are constantly kept on the backfoot, and thus disempowered, even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. The shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly, but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. The upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. For every give, there’s a take, and thus, a harmony between action and horror is reached.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms.

Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\'ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\'t) drowned my joy out.\n                     \n                     I don\'t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight.

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.
             

              The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince.

Fan-favorite character, Chloe Frazer, must enlist the aid of renowned mercenary Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End in order to recover a fabled ancient Indian artifact and keep it out of the hands of a ruthless war profiteer. Together, they’ll venture deep into the mountains of India in search of the legendary artifact. Along the way, they’ll learn to work together to unearth the mystery of the artifact, fight their way through fierce opposition, and prevent the region from falling into chaos.","[""I was worried that the retirement of Nathan would leave Uncharted without anything to carry a story, as I never considered Chloe a very interesting character in 2. Thankfully, Lost Legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story, that doesn't ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. The gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return, though the climbing is still annoying. Each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting, the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. On the open-zone section in the beginning I have conflicted feelings. On one hand, the dialouge between Chloe and Nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial, and I enjoyed the scenery. However, this series has always been about maintaining momentum. I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games, after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. The game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards, but I can't say the section left a good impression overall. The rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. The villain is nothing special, the platforming is cool and rhytmic, but not very complex, and there aren't really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. I don't mind though, I am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with, a role it easily fulfills."", 'The final Uncharted game (for now atleast) and its....fine.', 'Bom', 'A dlc do melhor jogo já feito, logo, a melhor dlc já feita.', 'Fun game, but generic as generic can possibly be. Amy Hennig as a writer was the soul of this franchise and without her Uncharted became stale. Neil Druckmann gives you a  modest american movie, but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write Chloe as a charismatic protagonist - he transformed her in another Nathan Drake -. Every action scene is copied from another Uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. The villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. All the merits of this game still belongs to Uncharted 1,2 and 3. Play only if you want a little movie experience, or watch the cutscenes on YouTube.', 'Everyone told me that Uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games, well what do you call this garbage then?  The Story is that Chloe hires Nadine (from the fourth game) to help her retrieve a ancient Indian artifact, this is an odd idea for a story, because Chloe knows about Nadine\'s history with her friends Nathan and Sam Drake, yet she works with someone who hates them, and doesn\'t think she will turn on her, and when she finds out that Sam was helping out, Nadine feels betrayed, assaults Chloe, and abandons her, until she apologizes, but Nadine says that she is now only helping Chloe out for the treasure, but don\'t worry, she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant, it happens so fast that there isn\'t even a moment where Nadine is completely over it, she randomly is, and they both act like it never happened, because the writing is terrible, when it comes to the character moments, and after they are trapped with Sam, him and Nadine both argue a lot, because of their history, but when interacting, Chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover, and his brother, more than she trusts her former lover\'s brother, which feels like Feminism, where the two girls get along, where as the man is played for a foil to it, which is frowned upon in this, and since Nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist, and Sam does, it makes Nadine even less likeable than she already was, and ruins the story completely, and studios need to stop this garbage.  The Characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances, thanks to Chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man, Nadine worsened by trying to make us like her, by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale, without even regretting her actions, and made Sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character, to the point where he doesn\'t even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that), stop writing feminism over male\'s feelings in games, and shame the people who think otherwise, the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first game\'s main villain, with his history with an old kingdom, but it doesn\'t go beyond that, and I enjoyed the traits of the second game\'s main villain more.  The Graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games, with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge, even if the second game\'s train scene was much better), but no where near as good as the fourth game, and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3, they have better looking events than the first game though.  The Gameplay is the same as before, only shorter to the point where it\'s less than half the length of games 2, 3, and 4, and in chapter 4, you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet, but no other moments like it make it feel random, silenced pistols were a great addition, but chapters 5, and especially 4 feel far too long, and could have been shortened, to make 2 more chapters, especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is.  The Music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere, and the song at the end ""Borders, by M.I.A"" is a bland and forgettable song.  Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, brought back the Uncharted franchise to consoles, and made me wish that it had stayed lost.']",4.7K,51,1.3K,754

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","['Pacman is such a fucking idiot jesus christ.

Less than 5 hours of my life as Geralt was spent on Gwent, triple triad in FFXIV does nothing for me and I actively despised Joustus in king of cards. I'm also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life, they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvel's illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so it's easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. The process of developing  wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. The games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. The snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game.  The ability to upgrade your cards, so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories , alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards, daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day.  Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards, getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula  where the marvel licence is only  the cherry on top of a delicious cake."", ""A card game with simple mechanics. Easy to get into difficult to master. You'll be surprised how many diverse decks you can come up with, with ass simple cards this game offers. Each match takes about 2 minutes or so and every match feels unique enough to keep you engaged in its core gameplay loop."", 'Marvel Snap is a bit like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and many others in the “game as a service” category: a great game you probably shouldn’t play.\n                     \n                     There is no denying that Marvel Snap is astoundingly great at being a quick and flashy 2-player card battler: card effects are superbly designed, so that almost every cards feels powerful and great to play; decks are exactly 12 cards, so it’s easy to deckbuild, experiment, and try many different strategies; and, at exactly 6 turns, each game is snappy I got used to firing up the matchmaking every time I have to go downstairs to grab a food delivery — and I live in the second story on my building. Win or lose, you’ll play your cards, watch their flashy effects, and have your dopamine hit. It really does feel great.\n                     \n                     Not to mention one of the best parts of the design, the titular snapping mechanic: with one tap, you can stake your progression with a “double or nothing” gamble. No matter if you’re really confident or just bluffing, the other player either needs to call it or concede defeat. This creates tension like a motherfucker.\n                     \n                     So let me get this straight, you’re thinking.

What’s the problem?\n                     \n                     The price.\n                     \n                     By 2023, it’s basically a cliché to say free-to-play games are the most expensive in the market. Everyone knows that. Snap is no different. You will download the game for free, sure, but you will pay — if not with money, than with the bad feeling of playing a lesser game than everyone else, and having to grind more to be less competitive. You’ll always be behind on the new cards, and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card.\n                     \n                     Just get it, you’ll think. It’s just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the Season Passes, you’ll think. It won’t bankrupt me, you’ll think. I don’t even have time to play a new indie game every month to completion. This game brings me fun consistently. I like Marvel heroes! Pretend it’s a subscription! You’ll think all of these things and others to justify continuously spending time on intangible items that would have been unlockable through gameplay if this was a good old regular paid game as god intended.\n                     \n                     And then one day you’ll write a review on Marvel Snap on Letterboxd and, as you write, you’ll realize what an idiot you’ve been to think this was okay. And you will decide, right then and there, while writing the penultimate paragraph, to just uninstall Snap and get a new indie game instead.\n                     \n                     I think I’ll start with Pizza Tower. Yeah. :) I hear great things, and it’s even cheaper than a Snap season pass.\n                     \n                     Now that feels great.\n                     \n                     …\n                     \n                     I once heard that the act of writing is in itself the act of thinking, just a bit slower and more methodical. I can now state with confidence: that tracks.', ""I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent, and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened, I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down, until I got something new that did the same thing, and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity, and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; there's not many explicit tutorials, but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced, and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time.""]",847,248,54,22

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","[""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\n                     \n                     is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made.

Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure, to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp, such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.

              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.
             

              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","['Deserves the praises that it gets.

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.
             

              Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.","[""definitely more cutscene than game here, i wasn't doing much with the controller through this game.

What is there left to fight for?”. The so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one.

A compilation that is somehow less than the sum of its parts is a very strange thing indeed. You get the Taxman remastered ports of sonic 1, 2, and CD here with the drop dash included, plus a brand new port of sonic 3 & knuckles also with drop dash support and in widescreen for the first time. The games all play perfectly fine but there's just a bunch of tiny little annoyances that add up over time, such as tails' AI not really working all that right and you constantly hear him jumping and smashing into things offscreen which can be annoying, theres some occasional bugs and whatnot, and they absolutely BUTCHERED the audio in sonic 3, using lower-quality audio recordings of the game audio plus worse re-recordings of replacement tunes for the licensed tracks.

Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5.', 'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.']",820,65,771,329

              Seven different stories featuring different protagonists, time periods, and gameplay styles await. In The Wild West, a wanderer with a bounty on his head fights for his life. In the Twilight of Edo Japan, a shinobi undertakes a secret mission. Experience these tales in any order you choose—the adventure is yours to control. What other stories will you uncover on the horizon...?","[""A really solid anthology of mini gold era Square RPGs lost to time, now easily accessible via this HD2D remake. Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', ""Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."", ""Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."", ""The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",1.1K,235,1.7K,1.9K

890,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Jun 23, 1991","['Sonic Team', 'Sega']",3.1,1.1K,1.1K,['Platform'],"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player.

I do wish the FOV was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming, though. This game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3D, but because it is now in 3D, theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in, so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2D metroids. The map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2D metroids. I didn't even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking, since those are kind of staples of the Metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before.

It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020.
             

              The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.
             

              Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.","[""After 3 years I finally managed to finish this!

Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.', 'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais, que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.', ""As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day, I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall, a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well, especially the parkour.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

Pit of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora.
             

              Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.
             

              Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.
             

              The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.
             

              Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.

Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.","[""another thing where if it got a remaster could be one of the very best. the controls hold it back at a fundamental level, and with the strives in accessibility in gaming made since its release im all but certain that would be alleviated in any kind of port. still an incredible game if you're Able to play it, but there shouldn't be a barrier like that in the first place"", ""In an unexpected sequel, Kid Icarus finds new light in an amazingly lighthearted world.

This title is a reimagining of the series, with the same protagonist Dante, but set in an alternate universe. The Dante in this game is very different from before, doing away with the trademark white hair and altering the main character as well as the game's tone with a much more Western influence. The gameplay is still largely identical as Dante engages many opponents with a fast fighting style, stringing together combos and hits in quick succession.","['Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido, com uma das melhores gameplays da série, e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa, com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas , como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar , os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos, o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game, o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante, no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal, o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game, na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais , porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot, dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme, diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original, o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante, que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original, e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época, apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem, o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

              Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure.

What I saw of the story was intriguing, but it's nowhere near enough to make me want to slog through the rest. The grind has a certain uniqueness that allows tiny incremental gains even at the level cap, but I can't shake the feeling that this just isn't respecting my time.

Varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. A smooth yet intense soundtrack from Grant Kirkhope. The dedication to its source material.

The controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. I think my main gripe with the game is just that I don\'t know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. Since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an FPS, the levels are designed with a lot of ""choke points"" where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. Naturally, especially considering this game is a james bond game, the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. Unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long, so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. Due to the fact that it\'s hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear, allowing the player to get lost frequently, it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. The soundtrack is good, and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the N64, with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown.

Couple that with one of the worst final boss fights I've ever played and generally overburdened combat throughout, and it's a hard game to recommend to anyone who isn't already deep into the series' marginalia."", 'Taking pretty much everything the original game did, expanding, and refining it, Prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire Metroid franchise. The dichotomy of the Dark World allows the game to keep the backtracking elements Prime 1 was infamous for, but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. And while it takes a bit to get there, it has some beautiful art direction, with Sanctuary Fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful, and I’m willing to bet it would look even better with an HD remaster like the first game got. Luckily, this game also rectified of Prime 1’s unfortunate flaws, a lack of an ending escape timer, and it does it in a great and memorable way, having you face off against Dark Samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire Dark Aether dimension being destroyed. Overall, this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in Metroid should get around to playing.', '1 step forward, 1.01 steps back.

I know ""lmao Echoes backtracking"" is a meme, but it really does drag the game out longer than it needs to. In particular, returning to the Temple Grounds after every main area and the Sky Temple key hunt during the endgame are the biggest culprits.\n                     \n                     The much higher level of difficulty is also a point of contention in the community, but I always found Prime 1 to be a little too easy, to Echoes\'s greater challenge is welcome in my eyes. The final boss in particular was an excellent challenge.\n                     \n                     Overall, Echoes is still an excellent game despite not being quite as good as Prime 1, and in my eyes is nonetheless a worthy sequel that adds almost as much as it subtracts from Prime 1.', ""The coolest part about Metroid is being alone in a vast and hostile environment.

Using the power of emulation, I got it completely playable on Dolphin, where she took the helm and played it the whole way through. And surely, Intelligent Systems was indeed responsible for making one of the most riveting tales told on the GCN, 2nd behind Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. A lot of people see this as the quintessential Fire Emblem game, as well as the peak. It gets close, but I think the reason why people deem that is because of its heightened fantasy elements. Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed “sub-humans” which is a funny play on racism, the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz, because that’s what they are, essentially. Laguz are humanoid creatures that can turn into either Lynxes, Saber Toothed Tigers, Lions, Crows, Hawks, White Herons, and of course, Dragons. Despite there being 3 Laguz nations, I actually listed every Laguz species I could think of, which shows how memorable this game is. Now compare that to Berwick Saga, released the exact same year. Berwick Saga has only Dragons, where they are nearly extinct and could’ve been written out of Berwick Saga entirely, considering they were used to explain the past of Berwick’s world, which is far cooler, in my opinion. Not that the added fantasy elements to FE9 are bad, it just feels a little off to me, considering your opponent in FE9 is still a human “Beorc” nation with a refined Imperial Army, with Izuka experimenting on how to use the Laguz to Daein’s advantage, a concept which came to fruition in FE10 and was one of the many good things that game pulled off despite the overambition. I remember my sister and I watching this cutscene from FE9 in 2014, where my father literally asked me how the heck this great red lion turned into a man, and I couldn’t help but think about how silly this 2005 CG cutscene looked when I first saw it.', ""another fun enough map-clicking, mice-moving experience, but doesn't inspire much the level of thought I'd like out of my rpg brain, and that really bothers me!""]",2.9K,155,1.5K,716

As a kid, my first playthrough was done alongside a friend, and we both challenged each other not to look up guides or anything.\n                     \n                     We would explore the game and share details with each other when we both got stuck, trying to see who could beat the game first. Whenever I found a cool weapon he hadn’t, I felt a sense of pride. I imagine he felt the same when he showed me where he got an upgrade that I didn’t find.\n                     \n                     That said… that’s the only context I hold fondness for and find it hard to return to and replay. The lack of a map was fun for a challenge back then but now it’s just cumbersome, the aspect ratio on the sprites is also not fun to work with. The game is just okay.', ""Super underrated but still flawed for sure. Probably the best thing is the atmosphere this game makes. There's such an eerie, claustrophobic feeling you get plunging deep into the caverns of an alien world, hunting for metroids that are gradually becoming stronger and more horrifying as you progress. And the ending sequence is incredibly cinematic and terrifying for a Game Boy game from 1991. But the fact that most rooms look exactly the same so you get lost easily and the somewhat clunky controls make it a bit hard to recommend. But if you can push through all that, this game is a great experience for any Metroid fan"", ""Metroid 2 is a fantastic game for the Game Boy. It's full of atmosphere, eerie music, hostile as fuck Metroids, and the kind of very satisfying progression I've grown used to with the previous Metroid. The only problem I see with the game is the lack of a map system can make it frustrating to nevigate. But there's a reason why this game has a dozen fan remakes. It's a pretty stellar Metroid game. Definitely worth the little time it takes on NSO."", ""I didn't play this game back in the Game Boy days and it is pretty rough to play today on the Switch's emulator. It's no wonder we've gotten both a great official and unofficial remake for it. I shouldn't be too hard on it though. It was doing some cool stuff for the Game Boy. It feels pretty atmospheric with some interesting music and you do feel like you're descending into this scary alien planet. Unfortunately, the lack of map and all the environments looking very similar (especially when it never got a colour version for the GBC) make it incredibly difficult to navigate. I know getting lost can sometimes be the point of these games but when you can't discern one area from another, it just becomes a frustrating experience. I did still get some enjoyment from hunting down all the metroids despite the repetition. I'm glad to have played through it but any revisit will be through either of the remakes."", 'Mucho mejor que la primera entrega', ""If there ever was some good to come out of the NSO service, it would be the new opportunity to find out just how much Game Boy games rule.

I was originally going to write something longer about that game itself, pointing to how Game Boy games having a smaller technical scope, and perhaps a looser leash than their console counterparts, could enable them to explore more unique narratives. In particular, the role of the protagonist is oddly subversive across the library.

Players slip into the role of a young martial artist named Ryo Hazuki, who is on the trail of his father's killer. On the way, players must talk with hundreds of characters, engage in martial arts battles, and marvel at the realistic depiction of the Japanese coastal town.","['Shenmue is definitely a game that will never be made again, and I mean that in both a good and a bad way. The amount of attention to detail that this game had in 1999 is unparalleled for it\'s time. It truly is Yu Suzuki\'s magnum opus as he decided to create a virtual living breathing community of people, and in a lot of ways he succeeded. Because of the less traditional approach that was made to create this game, a less traditional mindset needs to be had to really enjoy this kind of game ngl. I think a good modern equivalent would be something like death stranding, a game where if you are able to slow down to the pace that the game asks of you, there\'s a lot to be had in the sort of atmospheric sense, but if you are going into the game expecting to play it like any other game, focusing on major goals and objectives as skillfully and efficiently as possible, then you are probably gonna be really bored and frustrated at the game. And that\'s not me trying to say ""if you have that kind of mindset, you wouldn\'t understand shenmue"", but more me saying ""this game is not for everyone and you should definitely know that going in if you want to experience this game to its fullest"". You gotta play on the game\'s terms, and not really on your own, in that sense. The gameplay just revolves asking people various things to get various hints on where to go next, and once you go to the next place you ask the people in that place where to go, and the cycle continues until you piece together the greater picture of whats going on. My reccomendation is just to give it a shot, and you will probably know within the first few hours whether or not the game is for you.', 'The entire game is a slog, but in the best way possible.', 'Played the HD remaster on Steam Deck for this one.

This classic is the quintessential showcase of ambition in the game sphere, as well as how those ambitions eventually ran up against insurmountable limitations.', 'had a deep obsession with this game for a while when I was like 12', ""Genuinely one of the best video games I've ever played, a time capsule of a video game that would later lead to being incredibly influential in ways most probably wouldn't think of in its gameplay and story structure.

1210,Street Fighter II,"Feb 01, 1991","['Capcom', 'U.S. Gold']",3.5,433,433,"['Arcade', 'Fighting']","A sequel to Street Fighter, Street Fighter II improved upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and special moves.
             

              Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.
             

              Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a ""double KO"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.
             

              After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.
             

              Like in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.
             

              Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","['The fighting game that redefined all fighting games.

Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play.

Despite being on the SNES, it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits, being the final SNES game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the SNES’s inception, and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5.', 'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.']",820,65,771,329

A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.
             

              The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.
             

              The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the ""Alert Mode."" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:
             

              If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
              
              However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.
              
              The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.
             

              The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.
             

              A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.","[""this would've been better if lupin III was there"", 'Absolutely incredible game, with elements I never could imagine being implemented in 1987.

You get to learn a lil bit more about sonys various IPs that you might not have otherwise known, I guess. Gameplaywise though this is definitely not smash brothers. You can only score points and defeat players by using super moves which makes most of the actual fighting kinda feel like irrelevant filler...? The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well, which just makes the overall experience underwhelming. However, I'd still say this is worth at least a curious play, since especially with modern sony being the party poopers that hate fun with the playstations legacy of IPs, we ain't seeing most of the first-party characters in this game ever comin back.

Each “book” has you playing as a different character, who all play pretty different, though being me I gravitated towards the nigh-uncontrollable flippy-dippy melee fighters. But with these characters, you are going through the same 8ish areas, fighting the same 30ish enemies, ending with one of the same 10ish bosses in each level, and it gets old really fast. I understand these assets probably cost a ton to produce and reusing them is resourceful, but it is so much padding. It negatively impacts the story too. It's a great, simple concept: viewing the lives of the children of these classic fantasy archetypes, with the conclusion that they are pretty much all horrible parents. However, it feels forced to go in certain directions just so I can fight the damn blue worm dragon for like the 5th book in a row. Not all of it is bad, I love seeing little details in one book heavily expanded and explained in another book (like seeing why Pooka ran the food store in book 1 explained in book 2). However, while it would require pretty extensive rewrites, I would’ve preferred a 10-15 hour game reusing less gameplay elements rather than a 35 hour journey that feels pretty tiring by the middle of book 3.

Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","[""Neat collection of remakes of 3 MGS games.

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.
             

              Toy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed.

The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.

In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","[""The console ports of this game don't suffer from the coin-munching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade.

Also, the visuals are a bit too bland for my liking. I get what they are going for here, with the stark red lighting in the seedy crime dens and industrial underground factories in which you carry out your violent missions, but it becomes stale by around the halfway point. The look and design of the world are clearly inspired by Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira, so it's a shame that the overreliance on a constant red and black color palate diminishes Ruiner's ability to live up to the beauty of that film's visuals. I'm sure this sort of thing works for some, if not most people but it did occasionally become an annoyance in my playthrough. As for the story, it's generally tolerable but never truly interesting or well-presented. that's fine, it doesn't ever overstay its welcome and can be easily ignored outside of maybe the very underwhelming ending.

We all thought that it had promise and it sure was unfortunate that the GBA version never manifested.\n                     \n                     The second game (Risky\'s Revenge) was more like a tech demo than an actual game, but releasing it as DSiWare meant that it didn\'t need to really be more of that. In the end, it had a bit of overworld, two dungeons, and a weirdly boring shmup section before the final boss. (No joking; I played through this game twice, several years apart, and I literally dozed off during the mermaid shmup part both times.) Truly, this series just needed a chance to get a new, REAL, release that would let it stretch its psuedo-Metroidvania wings and be an amazing game!\n                     \n                     Well, we more-or-less got that with Pirate\'s Curse. While the Metroidvania aspects were still very simplistic - the world was broken up into several islands, most of which had extremely linear maps - the new pirate abilities were much more fun and easy to use than the old transformations, so it was still fun to backtrack through the islands to find hidden items. (The series is closer to a sidescrolling Zelda, now that I think about it, since there are the dungeons that are separate from the overworld and don\'t require a revisit unless you happen to miss something.) At the time, I (among others) thought that they still needed to make the next step towards a ""proper"" Metroidvania and they\'d truly have something.\n                     \n                     Then there was Half-Genie Hero. First off, it was weird that they began the Kickstarter for this game\n                     \n                      after\n                     \n                     Pirate\'s Curse had been announced, but\n                     \n                      before\n                     \n                     it actually released. We had only played the original game and Risky\'s Revenge at this point, and had the promise of Pirate\'s Curse releasing within a year or two. Additionally, the as-yet-unreleased Pirate\'s Curse had the best character art in the series (thanks to IntiCreates aiding with parts of the game) as well as the best pixel art, HGH went with more of a chibi-styled, smooth style. Still, more Shantae was more Shantae, and it felt like the series was finally getting its due (even if the fans had to pay for some of the development). Ultimately, though, the game was closer to a Mega Man X entry than the earlier games\' Metroidvania/sidescrolling Zelda style. There was no overworld with dungeons, but instead several independent platforming stages that you would select from a list. As with the MMX games, you could return to completed stages with new abilities to find more powerups. Unlike the MMX games, though, in which you get both permanent upgrades (helmet, boots, etc.) and special weapons you can easily swap between, Shantae has to stop and do a transformation dance in order to use her new abilities. It leads to a slower, less fun, platforming experience and I was ultimately disappointed in the game.\n                     \n                     Finally, this leads us to Seven Sirens. We finally got what we wanted, in a monkey\'s paw sort of way. There\'s a full, interconnected, Metroidvania map now! ...But there are also the Zelda-like dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld. While some of these have been fun in earlier games, the dungeons I played in SS are very simple and straightforward. I\'d rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles. Additionally, early on you get an ability that reveals secrets, ranging from gems (money) to hidden platforms. The unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden, which is basically almost every screen, requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is. Most of the time, it\'s nothing special, and this power also uses mana (or whatever), so you need to fill it up after using it several times.\n                     \n                     All that to say that the series has come close to greatness, but never quite reaches it, and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocre-at-best games.', ""I debate back and forth whether or not I like this or pirate's curse more. I like the change to one single open Metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past. The way transformations work is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are, but the dances feel a bit lame. There's so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time there's nothing more than gems that you get out of them.\n                     \n                     I found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wack as well. I played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much, much harder at the beginning. You are starved for healing items and resources, which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later. But by about 33% through the game I had more than enough money to keep myself capped on all of the healing items.\n                     \n                     The progression feels a bit too formulaic as well, with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end. That said, I enjoyed the game overall. The world is fun to explore, the powers are interesting and the music is great."", ""Mixing the pirate's curse and half-genue forbids, this game makes for a fun time. While not as fluid as other titles, the focus is in the metroidvania aspect this time. An enjoyable game with an alright story."", 'Some of the writing was kind of funny, and the art was nice, but other than that it felt pretty phoned-in.', ""Thank goodness we have another Metroidvania-style Shantae game, and this time it's the classic kind. In terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga, the overworld graphics and the portraits be looking pretty cute, and although the music may be the weakest in the saga, it has some catchy tunes. As for gameplay, they finally fixed the transformations problem, even if they're still not as good as the pirate gear in Pirate's Curse it's a step in the right direction. The game is great and a lot of fun, but it has some problems. The bosses are pretty bad, most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attacks and then hitting them for a while, rinse and repeat, although a couple of them are admittedly fun. The animated sequences look pretty rough too, but it's a noble concept that I hope to see expanded in later games. Finally, good god, trying to beat this game with 100% completion is a freaking chore, as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasn't been relevant in a while, and there being no markers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity.

A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.","[""As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially"", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\'m convinced only really ""hit"" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\n                     \n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\n                     \n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic ""tap X"" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\n                     \n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\n                     \n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\'s not great, but I\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\'t shoved in your face by ""cinematic"" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\n                     \n                     The ""open world"" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\n                     \n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\'t justify playing this game.', ""'na verga"", ""'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.

The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms.
