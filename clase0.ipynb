While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method.

Getting ending s and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect a fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments I’ve seen in fiction as a whole']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>18K </td><td>1.1K</td><td>6.2K</td><td>3.6K</td></tr>\n",

I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\\n                     \\n                     -The pacing of the game\\n                     \\n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\\n                     \\n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\\n                     \\n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\\n                     \\n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\\n                     \\n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)\", 'Vanilla was my first persona and smt game.

Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception.

Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially\", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\\'m convinced only really \"hit\" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\\'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\\n                     \\n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\\'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\\n                     \\n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\\'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\\'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic \"tap X\" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\\n                     \\n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\\'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\\n                     \\n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\\'s not great, but I\\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\\'t shoved in your face by \"cinematic\" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\\n                     \\n                     The \"open world\" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\\n                     \\n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\\'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\\'t justify playing this game.', \"'na verga\", \"'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim. It's basically just Skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. It honestly felt kind of similar to the original God of War games in that way.\", \"For a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. Its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, I loved it for the first 3/4 of the game. However...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, there's a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. But most of the game is great and there is so much character creation it's ridiculous, DLC's were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two.\", 'Action RPG Incrível']</td><td>1.2K</td><td>22</td><td>365</td><td>106</td></tr>\n",

Join the protagonist in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 game as he rides a mine cart, a hang glider or skims through water surface in his rescue attempt. With seven zones and three acts each, this Sega Game Gear video game is a rollercoaster ride where you get rewarded at the end of each act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>['Played as part of Sonic Gems Collection on the Gamecube.', \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2, on the Sega GameGear and Master system made me want to run off a cliff with a hang glider despite having no idea what's at the bottom of the cliff.\", 'Fuck chemical plant zone', \"I don't think this game is actually that bad, though the level design is certainly a bit dire on game gear. The screen crunch and overall high difficulty def makes it a struggle, but the level themes are really cool and I like the music. The gimmicks like the air bubbles and hang glider are fun too. Having the final world be locked behind the chaos emeralds is kinda lame and the bad ending is a bit sad so good luck getting those emeralds!\", 'bad lol', \"I got the bad ending (when you don't find all the Chaos Emeralds) so I think I'll go back and find them to unlock the 7th Zone. With that being said, the game is really hard if you don't have each level memorized. Even the boss fights are challenging since you can't get rings so you'll lose after only one hit. I own the physical game but played it on my 3DS so I have save states to help me out.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n",

       "              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n",

       "              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.</td><td>[\"It's a game. It's guitar hero. If you like guitar hero, you are gonna like this. The setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. I heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and I can kind of see that but also not really? Most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. This game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so that's neat. There are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so GH maniacs still have fun things to do I feel. Overall, it's more guitar hero. You can't go wrong with guitar hero, though I can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline.\", 'Major rhythm game fatigue

For the first time in the series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>['i feel offended', \"Every 5 years I give it another shot.

The player is able to run, jump and shoot projectiles at enemies they encounter. Furthermore, the player will be able to acquire both weapons and abilities from enemies they defeat. The game will feature an intro level followed by the eight main stages, which are freely chosen in any order by the player. At the end of each stage, Beck, the protagonist, must face one of the other eight \"Mighty Number\" units in a boss battle. A final set of stages are unlocked at the end of the game, leading up to the final showdown.

Several improvements have been made over its prequel, and it can be seen in overall smoother and more balanced gameplay. As in previous game, you will commandeer various turrets and vehicles which will add to firepower but will leave you with rails-driven gameplay. One of the new weapons is a jet-pack which lets you jump and semi-fly with unlimited ammo as a part of new exoskeleton. The environment can sometimes be destroyed or used to your advantage, shooting barrels or certain plants will take out nearby enemy soldiers. Beside single-player campaign, Killzone 3 offers an upgraded version of Killzone 2's multiplayer. The game is also the first in the franchise to support 3D TVs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>['Played the beta on a friends ps3 and thought the game looked so good that I decided to get a ps3 to play it too.

I decided to give this game a spin, and I have some thoughts.

The story, while nothing complex, is innovatively paced regardless of successful progression or not, without being penalised, keeping things moving and interesting despite your skill level. The pixel art is magnificent, and while some characters might feel a bit bland, they are still distinct and levelling newcomers is far from grindy, ensuring gameplay is varied without making it too tedious.\", \"This is a neat game I played at a REALLY WEIRD time in my life that I'm hopeful to never have to tell anyone about. It was good for then, but now it's tied to that in a way I can't really untangle it from. I do recommend it as a co-op roguelike RPG thing, especially because the way it drip feeds story is a good first attempt at following the example Hades set.

The game is oozing with sonic team charm all over the place, but sometimes the games mechanics will just screw you over, mostly in the fact that billy is kinda useless without an egg, so if theres a situation where your egg gets somewhere you can't go or you have to be seperated from your egg, then that makes you kinda just a sitting duck for a while. Other than that, its a totally servicable platformer with plenty of things to do and a BANGIN OST. I'd say check it out, but I don't think its a must-play or anything. If you are the type of person that would even look at a game featuring a chicken boy rolling eggs around then I think you'll find something to love here.\", 'billy didn’t expect me to have hours of katamari tucked away so i was ready for his little rolly polly egg game', 'My father won this game for me and my sister before we even owned a GameCube.

Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.', \"Probably the closest we'll get to a good Back to the

Game is also terribly optimized for storage.\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td>269 </td><td>79</td><td>388</td><td>602</td></tr>\n",

Getting ending s and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect a fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments I’ve seen in fiction as a whole'{]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 18K  & 1.1K & 6.2K & 3.6K\\\\\n",

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)\", 'Vanilla was my first persona and smt game.

Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me.

Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & {[}\"As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially\", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\\textbackslash{}'m convinced only really \"hit\" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\\textbackslash{}'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\\textbackslash{}'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\\textbackslash{}'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\\textbackslash{}'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic \"tap X\" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\\textbackslash{}'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\\textbackslash{}'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\\textbackslash{}'s not great, but I\\textbackslash{}'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\\textbackslash{}'t shoved in your face by \"cinematic\" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     The \"open world\" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\\textbackslash{}'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\\textbackslash{}'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\\textbackslash{}n                     \\textbackslash{}n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\\textbackslash{}'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\\textbackslash{}'t justify playing this game.', \"'na verga\", \"'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim. It's basically just Skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. It honestly felt kind of similar to the original God of War games in that way.\", \"For a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. Its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, I loved it for the first 3/4 of the game. However...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, there's a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. But most of the game is great and there is so much character creation it's ridiculous, DLC's were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two.\", 'Action RPG Incrível'{]} & 1.2K & 22 & 365 & 106\\\\\n",

Join the protagonist in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 game as he rides a mine cart, a hang glider or skims through water surface in his rescue attempt. With seven zones and three acts each, this Sega Game Gear video game is a rollercoaster ride where you get rewarded at the end of each act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & {[}'Played as part of Sonic Gems Collection on the Gamecube.', \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2, on the Sega GameGear and Master system made me want to run off a cliff with a hang glider despite having no idea what's at the bottom of the cliff.\", 'Fuck chemical plant zone', \"I don't think this game is actually that bad, though the level design is certainly a bit dire on game gear. The screen crunch and overall high difficulty def makes it a struggle, but the level themes are really cool and I like the music. The gimmicks like the air bubbles and hang glider are fun too. Having the final world be locked behind the chaos emeralds is kinda lame and the bad ending is a bit sad so good luck getting those emeralds!\", 'bad lol', \"I got the bad ending (when you don't find all the Chaos Emeralds) so I think I'll go back and find them to unlock the 7th Zone. With that being said, the game is really hard if you don't have each level memorized. Even the boss fights are challenging since you can't get rings so you'll lose after only one hit. I own the physical game but played it on my 3DS so I have save states to help me out. I had some enjoyment for it so that counts for something, but not the best Sonic game to start with, in my opinion.\"{]}

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n",

       "              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n",

       "              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game. & {[}\"It's a game. It's guitar hero. If you like guitar hero, you are gonna like this. The setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. I heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and I can kind of see that but also not really? Most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. This game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so that's neat. There are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so GH maniacs still have fun things to do I feel. Overall, it's more guitar hero. You can't go wrong with guitar hero, though I can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline.\", 'Major rhythm game fatigue

For the first time in the series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & {[}'i feel offended', \"Every 5 years I give it another shot.

The player is able to run, jump and shoot projectiles at enemies they encounter. Furthermore, the player will be able to acquire both weapons and abilities from enemies they defeat. The game will feature an intro level followed by the eight main stages, which are freely chosen in any order by the player. At the end of each stage, Beck, the protagonist, must face one of the other eight \"Mighty Number\" units in a boss battle. A final set of stages are unlocked at the end of the game, leading up to the final showdown.

Several improvements have been made over its prequel, and it can be seen in overall smoother and more balanced gameplay. As in previous game, you will commandeer various turrets and vehicles which will add to firepower but will leave you with rails-driven gameplay. One of the new weapons is a jet-pack which lets you jump and semi-fly with unlimited ammo as a part of new exoskeleton. The environment can sometimes be destroyed or used to your advantage, shooting barrels or certain plants will take out nearby enemy soldiers. Beside single-player campaign, Killzone 3 offers an upgraded version of Killzone 2's multiplayer. The game is also the first in the franchise to support 3D TVs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & {[}'Played the beta on a friends ps3 and thought the game looked so good that I decided to get a ps3 to play it too.

The story, while nothing complex, is innovatively paced regardless of successful progression or not, without being penalised, keeping things moving and interesting despite your skill level. The pixel art is magnificent, and while some characters might feel a bit bland, they are still distinct and levelling newcomers is far from grindy, ensuring gameplay is varied without making it too tedious.\", \"This is a neat game I played at a REALLY WEIRD time in my life that I'm hopeful to never have to tell anyone about. It was good for then, but now it's tied to that in a way I can't really untangle it from. I do recommend it as a co-op roguelike RPG thing, especially because the way it drip feeds story is a good first attempt at following the example Hades set.

The game is oozing with sonic team charm all over the place, but sometimes the games mechanics will just screw you over, mostly in the fact that billy is kinda useless without an egg, so if theres a situation where your egg gets somewhere you can't go or you have to be seperated from your egg, then that makes you kinda just a sitting duck for a while. Other than that, its a totally servicable platformer with plenty of things to do and a BANGIN OST. I'd say check it out, but I don't think its a must-play or anything.

I don’t remember much of the episodes except for the first one so I can’t really give the game a rating.

Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.', \"Probably the closest we'll get to a good Back to the

Game is also terribly optimized for storage.\"{]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 269  & 79 & 388 & 602\\\\\n",

The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics. Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before.', 'This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in. I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting. The game isn’t perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Getting ending s and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect a fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments I’ve seen in fiction as a whole']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 18K  | 1.1K | 6.2K | 3.6K |\n",

Vai tomar no cu, Ryuji', \"This game is great, and to many people this is probably one of the greatest JRPGs if not, overall game of all time. I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\\n                     \\n                     -The pacing of the game\\n                     \\n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\\n                     \\n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\\n                     \\n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\\n                     \\n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\\n                     \\n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)\", 'Vanilla was my first persona and smt game. Kinda feels like coming home whenever i play it', 'If you have a spare 100 hours lying around do this, was pretty good (4 better tho)', 'i love goro akechi', \"Played like 50 hrs, I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 3.9K | 795  | 2.1K | 2.2K |\n",

The game makes amazing use of 3D environments to add a new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level, and I had a lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges. While the main content is easy and very chill, bonus optional content can be very tricky.

A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [\"As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially\", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\\'m convinced only really \"hit\" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\\'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\\n                     \\n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\\'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\\n                     \\n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\\'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\\'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic \"tap X\" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\\n                     \\n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\\'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\\n                     \\n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\\'s not great, but I\\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\\'t shoved in your face by \"cinematic\" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\\n                     \\n                     The \"open world\" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\\n                     \\n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\\'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\\'t justify playing this game.', \"'na verga\", \"'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim. It's basically just Skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. It honestly felt kind of similar to the original God of War games in that way.\", \"For a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. Its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, I loved it for the first 3/4 of the game. However...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, there's a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. But most of the game is great and there is so much character creation it's ridiculous, DLC's were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two.\", 'Action RPG Incrível'] | 1.2K | 22 | 365 | 106 |\n",

With seven zones and three acts each, this Sega Game Gear video game is a rollercoaster ride where you get rewarded at the end of each act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ['Played as part of Sonic Gems Collection on the Gamecube.', \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2, on the Sega GameGear and Master system made me want to run off a cliff with a hang glider despite having no idea what's at the bottom of the cliff.\", 'Fuck chemical plant zone', \"I don't think this game is actually that bad, though the level design is certainly a bit dire on game gear. The screen crunch and overall high difficulty def makes it a struggle, but the level themes are really cool and I like the music. The gimmicks like the air bubbles and hang glider are fun too. Having the final world be locked behind the chaos emeralds is kinda lame and the bad ending is a bit sad so good luck getting those emeralds!\", 'bad lol', \"I got the bad ending (when you don't find all the Chaos Emeralds) so I think I'll go back and find them to unlock the 7th Zone. With that being said, the game is really hard if you don't have each level memorized. Even the boss fights are challenging since you can't get rings so you'll lose after only one hit. I own the physical game but played it on my 3DS so I have save states to help me out. I had some enjoyment for it so that counts for something, but not the best Sonic game to start with, in my opinion.\"]

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n",

       "              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n",

       "              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game. | [\"It's a game. It's guitar hero. If you like guitar hero, you are gonna like this. The setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. I heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and I can kind of see that but also not really? Most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. This game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so that's neat. There are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so GH maniacs still have fun things to do I feel. Overall, it's more guitar hero. You can't go wrong with guitar hero, though I can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline.\", 'Major rhythm game fatigue

For the first time in the series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['i feel offended', \"Every 5 years I give it another shot.

The player is able to run, jump and shoot projectiles at enemies they encounter. Furthermore, the player will be able to acquire both weapons and abilities from enemies they defeat. The game will feature an intro level followed by the eight main stages, which are freely chosen in any order by the player. At the end of each stage, Beck, the protagonist, must face one of the other eight \"Mighty Number\" units in a boss battle. A final set of stages are unlocked at the end of the game, leading up to the final showdown. An additional level starring Call is also available at some point, provided through one of the completed stretch goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [\"I'd rather have nothing\", 'Better than nothing', \"I feel like I was able to go into this game on somewhat unique terms, having not been a Mega Man when this game launched and then, years later, coming into it hot after binge playing Mega Man 1-11 in 3 months.

Several improvements have been made over its prequel, and it can be seen in overall smoother and more balanced gameplay. As in previous game, you will commandeer various turrets and vehicles which will add to firepower but will leave you with rails-driven gameplay. One of the new weapons is a jet-pack which lets you jump and semi-fly with unlimited ammo as a part of new exoskeleton. The environment can sometimes be destroyed or used to your advantage, shooting barrels or certain plants will take out nearby enemy soldiers. Beside single-player campaign, Killzone 3 offers an upgraded version of Killzone 2's multiplayer. The game is also the first in the franchise to support 3D TVs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['Played the beta on a friends ps3 and thought the game looked so good that I decided to get a ps3 to play it too.

Over the past year or so I’ve decided to go through the Killzone games after beating almost all the Halo series and the Resistance series (which I’ll review at some point later on). Having beaten Killzone 2 last year and temporarily given up on Mercenary after having my save data corrupted unknowingly, and with a buddy of mine going through the Killzone series on the highest difficulty as well. I decided to give this game a spin, and I have some thoughts. First I’ll go with the plot.', 'Rating: 7/10 -  Good', 'My review for killzone 2 applies here but the story is way worse. the gameplay is way more fun but they sacrificed the world building they set up for the past two games and it is a major blow to the franchise.', 'Great game despite ruining the franchise', 'Too short, controls too janky, predictable story, audio bugs.']

Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair.

The story, while nothing complex, is innovatively paced regardless of successful progression or not, without being penalised, keeping things moving and interesting despite your skill level. The pixel art is magnificent, and while some characters might feel a bit bland, they are still distinct and levelling newcomers is far from grindy, ensuring gameplay is varied without making it too tedious.\", \"This is a neat game I played at a REALLY WEIRD time in my life that I'm hopeful to never have to tell anyone about. It was good for then, but now it's tied to that in a way I can't really untangle it from. I do recommend it as a co-op roguelike RPG thing, especially because the way it drip feeds story is a good first attempt at following the example Hades set.

The game is oozing with sonic team charm all over the place, but sometimes the games mechanics will just screw you over, mostly in the fact that billy is kinda useless without an egg, so if theres a situation where your egg gets somewhere you can't go or you have to be seperated from your egg, then that makes you kinda just a sitting duck for a while. Other than that, its a totally servicable platformer with plenty of things to do and a BANGIN OST. I'd say check it out, but I don't think its a must-play or anything. If you are the type of person that would even look at a game featuring a chicken boy rolling eggs around then I think you'll find something to love here.\", 'billy didn’t expect me to have hours of katamari tucked away so i was ready for his little rolly polly egg game', 'My father won this game for me and my sister before we even owned a GameCube.

The Dreamcast version, also released in 1999, features both the original and revised versions of the arcade game in their original forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ['i laughed, i cried, but most importantly I got 2-0’d by vinesauce joel one day. awesome game', 'el de arcade es mejor, lo pase después de varias noches de sexo desenfrenado con mi panita Gabo, comentario muy gordito pero tiene minijuegos que adaptan partes del manga que no pueden mostrarse como pelea y eso me gusto, osea usuarios de stand que no peleaban como tal etc etc', 'this game is very bizarre??', 'the super story mode in the playstation version has a lot of weird silly minigames and cutscenes. play it for the most unique adaptation of stardust crusaders', 'Capcom really make this game with passion.

Only a perfect blend of logic and skill will get you past the deadly obstacles that lie in waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ['this one raises the bar for both video games and sci-fi for anyone who experiences it', 'Esse jogo não tem uma linha de diálogo sequer.', \"A favorite game of mine.

The story adds onto the movies without ruining anything from them. The gameplay is also pretty cool and fun, the puzzles are challenging but not annoying.', 'i need to give this another try', 'When I was little I was obsessed with Back to the Future and then I found this game on my iPad. I played it all the time and I made my dad buy all the episodes. I didn’t even really know much in english so I was always asking my dad what this and that means lol. Poor dad. I don’t remember much of the episodes except for the first one so I can’t really give the game a rating. Anyways I really love this game still and I am very sad it is no longer available on my iPad :((', \"Probably the closest we'll ever get to BTTF 4 but honestly they pulled it off.\", 'Für mich der inoffizielle vierte Teil der Reihe. Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.', \"Probably the closest we'll get to a good Back to the

Players embark on an epic adventure in a rich, living world with three AI companions, known as Pawns. These partners fight independently, demonstrating prowess and ability that they have developed based on traits learnt from each player. PC users can share these Pawns online and reap rewards of treasure, tips and strategy hints for taking down the terrifying enemies. Pawns can also be borrowed when specific skills are needed to complete various challenging quests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ['Underrated.', 'A grandes rasgos, es como un MMO pero para un jugador.

Astarion is funny as fuck, but is also just one dimensional. If you wanna be good then don't have him in your party because he will not like anything you do. Will is the only party member that I even remotely like. He is at least a nice guy with an okay backstory. Game is also terribly optimized for storage.\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 269  | 79 | 388 | 602 |\n",

       "3    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… and teach his son to do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "1494 Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\\n             \\n\\n              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\\n             \\n\\n              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.\n",

The gameplay is the same as it's previous entries, where the player searches for objects and uses weapons to defend against grotesque monsters while solving puzzles to advance further into the game.

Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -The pacing of the game\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)\", 'Vanilla was my first persona and smt game. Kinda feels like coming home whenever i play it', 'If you have a spare 100 hours lying around do this, was pretty good (4 better tho)', 'i love goro akechi', \"Played like 50 hrs, I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened.

       "21   ['The more mature story (by recent Pokémon standards) , lore ramifications for sinnoh , and the amazing real time catch mechanics make this game one of the best Pokémon games ever easily ;though a good Pokémon is still far from being a good video game generally speaking . The textures are muddy , the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom , and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot. I still feel like Pokémon gameplay has peaked here but they just don’t let these games cook long enough and only get away with it because Pokémon fans only play Pokémon and don’t branch out to know what’s actually good', 'Really refreshing take on the series, just a little empty overall.', \"Great game! but it would be better if there was voice acting and no sudden cutscenes every 2 seconds. And it gets pretty bad as you play it. But if you're finding a good first Pokemon game, I would recommend it tho!\", 'Aside from obvious performance issues, this was easily the most fun ive had with the Pokemon series since the release of Black/White. i hope we get a follow up game in the future that focuses on the unova region and kyurem', \"Put me in feudal japan with an Iphone and I probably wouldn't get as far as I did here\",

For context i have played xenoblade 1dx and seen 2 on youtube, so i will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1. The concept is immedietly quite interesting, although', \"hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The game makes amazing use of 3D environments to add a new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level, and I had a lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges. While the main content is easy and very chill, bonus optional content can be very tricky. Only thing I disliked were a few difficulty spikes in some side objectives and the lack of a \"restart from checkpoint\" button but, overall, this is a masterful game that makes the most out of its simplicity as a Kirby game, but this time you can swallow a whole car and spit it unharmed.', \"kirby and the ermmmmm???

The later levels and the treasure road portals make great use of every power. The hidden waddle dees push you to explore, sure, but also demand perfection for a few bosses.

If anything, I was left wanting just a taste more.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Overall, a great Kirby game and a great video game.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "29   [\"a captivating journey from start to finish. this uses its characters and dialogue to such great effect, making everything feel intertwined. our protagonist's mind especially was so interesting to delve into and finding out little bits and pieces of his identity was just a joy to do. while the game lets u do things without kitsuragi at times, i never wanted to as he brought much to every scene he was active in. very satisfying resolution and to top it off, its simply hilarious at times as well\\\\n                     \\\\n                     i love kim kitsuragi sm\", 'I love you, Kim Kitsuragi', 'one of the most interesting, politically poignant pieces of art i’ve ever had the pleasure of consuming', \"I couldn't finish day 1.

I might pick this up again sometime in the future, but I don't think this game is for me.\", 'Still unsure whether I like the ending or not and for a game with some of the best worldbuilding I’ve ever seen I wish more of the game had to do with that world - but at the end of the day it’s still the best writing any game has ever had so can’t be too mad', \"I was very scared of playing this because I knew it has a lot of text and a crazy big skill tree.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     First day ingame was horrible, I kept making bad decisions and throws and even got a game-over. Also the game talks about politics in a deep and serious way so I kinda felt like a kid in an adult game haha. I honestly thought I would just abandonned it but at the end of the day there's this discussion you have with Kitsuragi and he's being very nice and comprehensive and it put me in a good mood; So I just decided to go with the fact that I'm playing a pretty bad cop and continue with the game.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     In the end I really liked it, beautiful art direction and visuals, I loved discovering more about the world. Tho I still probably didn't really understood all the themes and ideas of this game ...\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Anyway this was the only good Nicktoons game bc you actually go to areas from the shows and the zones are pretty comfy, the sequels were all just, like, generic islands and industrial regions and shit\", 'just another mario party rip off that i liked', \"This game really is not very entertaining. I love the concept of this game a lot. It's a lot of fun to see these characters interacting and its really charming. That's all the positives I got for this game tho. The gameplay is not engaging or special at all. It's bland and the graphics are def dated.

Visually very nice to look at and good optimization. Very artsy landscapes and cutscenes. Definitely enjoyed that. The long walks to merchants, side quests, loot etc. were too much sometimes. Finished the main story, but am not motivated to 100% side quests or collectibles cause the travel can be really slow.

Si bien los jefes están buenos, los demás enemigos se repiten demasiado y son muy genéricos, las escenas cinematográficas son lamentables, en el endgame todos los personajes están rotísimos y que leveleen los personajes aunque no esten en la party es ridículo, dentro de todo es un RPG descente, me gustó sobre todo por poder jugar con 3 de mis personajes favoritos de el LoL.', 'Puzzles are fun,

       "1490 [\"As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially\", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\\\\'m convinced only really \"hit\" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\\\\'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\\\\'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\\\\'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\\\\'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic \"tap X\" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\\\\'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\\\\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\\\\'s not great, but I\\\\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\\\\'t shoved in your face by \"cinematic\" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     The \"open world\" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\\\\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\\\\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\\\\'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\\\\'t justify playing this game.', \"'na verga\", \"'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim. It's basically just Skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. It honestly felt kind of similar to the original God of War games in that way.\", \"For a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. Its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, I loved it for the first 3/4 of the game. However...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, there's a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. But most of the game is great and there is so much character creation it's ridiculous, DLC's were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two.\", 'Action RPG Incrível']\n",

The screen crunch and overall high difficulty def makes it a struggle, but the level themes are really cool and I like the music. The gimmicks like the air bubbles and hang glider are fun too. Having the final world be locked behind the chaos emeralds is kinda lame and the bad ending is a bit sad so good luck getting those emeralds!\", 'bad lol', \"I got the bad ending (when you don't find all the Chaos Emeralds) so I think I'll go back and find them to unlock the 7th Zone. With that being said, the game is really hard if you don't have each level memorized. Even the boss fights are challenging since you can't get rings so you'll lose after only one hit. I own the physical game but played it on my 3DS so I have save states to help me out. I had some enjoyment for it so that counts for something, but not the best Sonic game to start with, in my opinion.\"]

The setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. I heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and I can kind of see that but also not really? Most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. This game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so that's neat. There are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so GH maniacs still have fun things to do I feel. Overall, it's more guitar hero.

The art direction still holds up in a lot of ways and even though the campaign is disappointing it was still fun to play with the different classes in multilayer.', 'Killzone 3 is a first person shooter exclusive for the Playstation 3 released in 2011 and developed by Guerilla Games. Over the past year or so I’ve decided to go through the Killzone games after beating almost all the Halo series and the Resistance series (which I’ll review at some point later on). Having beaten Killzone 2 last year and temporarily given up on Mercenary after having my save data corrupted unknowingly, and with a buddy of mine going through the Killzone series on the highest difficulty as well. I decided to give this game a spin, and I have some thoughts. First I’ll go with the plot.', 'Rating: 7/10 -  Good', 'My review for killzone 2 applies here but the story is way worse. the gameplay is way more fun but they sacrificed the world building they set up for the past two games and it is a major blow to the franchise.', 'Great game despite ruining the franchise', 'Too short, controls too janky, predictable story, audio bugs.']

The story, while nothing complex, is innovatively paced regardless of successful progression or not, without being penalised, keeping things moving and interesting despite your skill level. The pixel art is magnificent, and while some characters might feel a bit bland, they are still distinct and levelling newcomers is far from grindy, ensuring gameplay is varied without making it too tedious.\", \"This is a neat game I played at a REALLY WEIRD time in my life that I'm hopeful to never have to tell anyone about. It was good for then, but now it's tied to that in a way I can't really untangle it from. I do recommend it as a co-op roguelike RPG thing, especially because the way it drip feeds story is a good first attempt at following the example Hades set. Making that a co-operative experience makes it more interesting as well, and honestly I think at this point the only time I ever want to engage with roguelikes again is co-operatively in weird times in my life.\", 'Rating: 7.6/10 - Pretty Good', \"The gameplay gets a little repetitive after a while, but each character is pretty distinct and since it doesn't take that much time to level them up, it's really easy to switch between them over the course of a playthrough.\", 'Really solid arpg.

       "1503 ['Truly a very large egg', \"Mechanics in this Katamari Sonic Adventure game are rough. 9/10 attempted jumps either get you killed or having only just the egg make it to the platform because your short ass is too tiny for this ride. Also never trust rails, I've died way too many times because of RAILS.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Fun game though, probably never gonna play it again.\", \"this game was hard as balls to find and buy, i spent like a decade looking for it. was it worth the wait? i mean kinda? The game is oozing with sonic team charm all over the place, but sometimes the games mechanics will just screw you over, mostly in the fact that billy is kinda useless without an egg, so if theres a situation where your egg gets somewhere you can't go or you have to be seperated from your egg, then that makes you kinda just a sitting duck for a while. Other than that, its a totally servicable platformer with plenty of things to do and a BANGIN OST. I'd say check it out, but I don't think its a must-play or anything. If you are the type of person that would even look at a game featuring a chicken boy rolling eggs around then I think you'll find something to love here.\", 'billy didn’t expect me to have hours of katamari tucked away so i was ready for his little rolly polly egg game', 'My father won this game for me and my sister before we even owned a GameCube.

The gameplay is also pretty cool and fun, the puzzles are challenging but not annoying.', 'i need to give this another try', 'When I was little I was obsessed with Back to the Future and then I found this game on my iPad. I played it all the time and I made my dad buy all the episodes. I didn’t even really know much in english so I was always asking my dad what this and that means lol. Poor dad. I don’t remember much of the episodes except for the first one so I can’t really give the game a rating. Anyways I really love this game still and I am very sad it is no longer available on my iPad :((', \"Probably the closest we'll ever get to BTTF 4 but honestly they pulled it off.\", 'Für mich der inoffizielle vierte Teil der Reihe. Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.', \"Probably the closest we'll get to a good Back to the

Game is also terribly optimized for storage.\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
